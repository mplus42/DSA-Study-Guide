ðŸš€ Step 1: Start with Basic Graph Traversal
    ðŸ‘‰ Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are the building blocks of all graph problems.
    ðŸ“Œ Why?

    They help in connectivity checks, cycle detection, shortest paths, and many other algorithms build upon them.
    Mastering these will make advanced topics easier to implement.
    ðŸŽ¯ What to do?

    Implement BFS & DFS on an adjacency list graph.
    Write them both iteratively and recursively.
    Try variations:
    Graph with disconnected components
    Directed vs. Undirected graphs
    Detecting cycles

ðŸš€ Step 2: Move to Shortest Path Algorithms
    ðŸ“Œ Next, learn Dijkstraâ€™s & Bellman-Ford since shortest paths appear frequently in interviews.
    ðŸŽ¯ What to do?

    Implement Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm using a priority queue (min-heap).
    Implement Bellman-Ford Algorithm and understand how it handles negative weights.

ðŸš€ Step 3: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
    ðŸ“Œ Why? Used for network designs, connectivity problems, etc.
    ðŸŽ¯ What to do?

    Implement Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm (uses Union-Find).
    Implement Primâ€™s Algorithm (uses a priority queue).

ðŸš€ Step 4: Advanced Graph Concepts
    âœ… Cycle Detection (Undirected: Union-Find, DFS, Directed: Recursion Stack)
    âœ… Topological Sorting (Kahnâ€™s Algorithm - BFS, DFS Approach)
    âœ… Strongly Connected Components (SCC) (Kosarajuâ€™s & Tarjanâ€™s Algorithms)
    âœ… Grid-Based Graph Problems (Flood Fill, Rotten Oranges)

ðŸ”¥ Learning Strategy
    ðŸ”¹ Write from scratch (no copy-pasting).
    ðŸ”¹ Solve at least 2-3 problems per concept.
    ðŸ”¹ Understand variations and edge cases.

ðŸš€ Step 5: Mock Interviews & Problem-Solving
    Once you're comfortable, start solving Google-style graph problems on LeetCode and conduct mock interviews to strengthen your problem-solving speed.
