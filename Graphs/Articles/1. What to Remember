You don’t need to memorize the exact code, but you do need to understand how to write it from scratch.

🔹 What You Need to Remember About Code for Interviews
Instead of memorizing the full code, focus on these aspects:

1️⃣ The Core Logic & Steps
    Example: For BFS, remember:
        Use a queue
        Mark nodes as visited
        Process neighbors iteratively
    You don’t need to memorize syntax, but you should recall how BFS works and be able to implement it.

2️⃣ The Key Data Structures
    BFS → Queue
    DFS → Stack (or Recursion)
    Dijkstra → Min-Heap (Priority Queue)
    Kruskal → Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

3️⃣ Edge Cases & Constraints
    What happens if the graph is disconnected?
    Can the graph have negative weights?
    Do you need to track visited nodes?

4️⃣ Write Code from Scratch (Practice)
    Instead of memorizing full code, practice writing from a blank file.
    Example: Given "Implement BFS", you should be able to write the function from memory, even if syntax is slightly off at first.
    
🔹 How to Approach Interview Coding Questions
✅ Recognize the pattern (e.g., "This is a shortest path problem, I need Dijkstra")
✅ Write the high-level steps first (before jumping into code)
✅ Use pseudocode to structure your approach
✅ Write and test the implementation
✅ Debug efficiently (identify mistakes logically, not by guessing)

🔹 What About Syntax?
If you're comfortable with JavaScript, syntax will come naturally with practice. If you struggle, focus on coding every day so writing loops, functions, and data structures becomes second nature.

👉 Bottom line:
❌ Don’t memorize entire code
✅ Do understand patterns and be able to implement them from scratch
