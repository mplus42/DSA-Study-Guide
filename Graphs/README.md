If you're preparing for Google interviews, you don’t need to memorize everything. Instead, focus on patterns, problem-solving techniques, and practical implementation. Here’s a structured way to remember and master all graph concepts effectively:

1️⃣ Categorize Graph Concepts into Core Patterns
    Instead of memorizing random topics, group them into patterns that repeatedly appear in problems.

🔹 Pattern 1: Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
    🔥 Must know: DFS, BFS, Connected Components
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Graph traversal means visiting each node in a graph.

        BFS (Breadth-First Search) → Level-by-level exploration (like ripples in water).
        DFS (Depth-First Search) → Go deep first, then backtrack.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Number of Islands 🏝️ (Leetcode 200)
        Rotten Oranges 🍊 (Leetcode 994)
        Word Ladder (Leetcode 127)
        Flood Fill (Leetcode 733)
        Surrounded Regions (Leetcode 130)

🔹 Pattern 2: Shortest Path Algorithms
    🔥 Must know: BFS (Unweighted), Dijkstra’s (Weighted), Bellman-Ford (Negative Weights)
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Find the shortest way to get from Point A to Point B in a graph.

        BFS → Best for unweighted graphs.
        Dijkstra’s Algorithm → Best for weighted graphs (no negative edges).
        Bellman-Ford Algorithm → Handles negative weights.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Cheapest Flights Within K Stops ✈️ (Leetcode 787)
        Network Delay Time ⏳ (Leetcode 743)
        Minimum Cost to Reach Destination 🛣️ (Leetcode 1631)
        Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (Leetcode 1091)
        Dijkstra’s Algorithm Implementation
        Bellman-Ford Algorithm Implementation

🔹 Pattern 3: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
    🔥 Must know: Prim’s & Kruskal’s Algorithm
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Find the cheapest way to connect all nodes with the least cost.

        Kruskal’s Algorithm → Sort edges, connect nodes (Uses Union-Find).
        Prim’s Algorithm → Start from any node, keep adding the cheapest edge.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Connecting Cities with Minimum Cost 🏙️ (Leetcode 1135)
        Min Cost to Connect All Points (Leetcode 1584)
        Prim’s Algorithm Implementation
        Kruskal’s Algorithm Implementation

🔹 Pattern 4: Topological Sort (DAGs)
    🔥 Must know: DFS + Stack, Kahn’s Algorithm
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Find the order of tasks when given dependencies.
        Example: “Finish course A before B” → Find valid order.

        Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS-based Topo Sort) → Remove nodes with zero dependencies.
        DFS-based Topo Sort → Explore deeply, then stack results.       
    💡 Common Questions:
        Course Schedule 📚 (Leetcode 207)
        Alien Dictionary (Leetcode 269)
        Course Schedule II (Leetcode 210)
        Find Eventual Safe States (Leetcode 802)


🔹 Pattern 5: Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
    🔥 Must know: Kosaraju’s Algorithm, Tarjan’s Algorithm
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Find groups of nodes that are fully connected in both directions.
        Example: A social group where everyone knows each other.

        Kosaraju’s Algorithm → DFS twice (Reverse graph & find SCCs).
        Tarjan’s Algorithm → DFS with low-link values.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Critical Connections in a Network (Leetcode 1192)
        Find Strongly Connected Components
        Kosaraju’s Algorithm Implementation
        Tarjan’s Algorithm Implementation

🔹 Pattern 6: Cycle Detection
    🔥 Must know: DFS-based for Directed Graphs, Union-Find for Undirected Graphs
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Check if a graph contains loops.

        Union-Find → Best for undirected graphs.
        DFS Recursion Stack → Best for directed graphs.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Find Eventual Safe States (Leetcode 802)
        Redundant Connection (Leetcode 684)
        Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph
        Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph

🔹 Pattern 7: Bipartiteness & Coloring
    🔥 Must know: BFS-based bipartiteness check
    💡 Simple Explanation:
        Can you split the graph into two groups where no two adjacent nodes are in the same group?
        Example: Divide people into two teams without conflicts.

        BFS Coloring → Alternate coloring nodes (0,1).
        DFS Coloring → Same concept, but using DFS.
    💡 Common Questions:
        Is Graph Bipartite? (Leetcode 785)
        Possible Bipartition (Leetcode 886)
        Graph Coloring Problem

2️⃣ Learn by Implementing & Visualizing
    Mere theory won’t help. Write code, visualize, and practice real problems.

    * Use visualization tools like: VisuAlgo, Graph Playground
    * Implement each core concept from scratch. Writing code from memory helps retain logic better than passive reading.

3️⃣ Create a Notion Table (DSA Pattern Table)
    Make a Notion table (or Google Sheets) with columns:

    When you struggle to recall something, just check your Notion table instead of searching from scratch.

    My notion table for graph patterns : https://adaptable-conga-0e3.notion.site/192d870215f8800d947bda9e9e29383a?v=192d870215f881a18968000c30557bc8

4️⃣ Use Spaced Repetition (Active Recall)
    Instead of rereading theory, test yourself daily:

    Day 1: Solve an easy problem from a pattern (e.g., BFS)
    Day 2: Solve a medium problem from the same pattern
    Day 3: Solve a different category (e.g., Shortest Path)
    Week 2: Re-attempt the same problems but from memory
    Use Anki flashcards to quiz yourself on concepts.

5️⃣ Practice Smartly with the 80/20 Rule
    Google interviews rarely go into niche graph topics like Eulerian Paths.
    
    ✅ Focus on the 20% of concepts that appear in 80% of interview problems.
        DFS/BFS 🔥 (High Priority)
        Dijkstra’s & MST (Medium Priority)
        SCC, Bridges, Flow (Low Priority for Interviews)

6️⃣ Discuss & Teach
    Explain graph problems to a friend (or even talk out loud to yourself).
    Write blogs or share explanations online (Reddit, StackOverflow).
    Teaching forces you to retain information.

7️⃣ Solve Problems in Mock Interviews
    Leetcode Contests (Simulates Google rounds)
    Mock Interviews on Pramp or Interviewing.io

🚀 Summary
👉 Don’t memorize everything—group problems into patterns
👉 Make a Cheatsheet – List all patterns with 1-2 lines explaining them
👉 Solve real problems instead of just reading : Solving 5 problems per pattern is enough
👉 Write & implement from scratch (no copy-paste)
👉 Use Notion tables + spaced repetition : Revise old problems every week
👉 Teach concepts to strengthen memory
👉 Use Flashcards (Anki) – Quiz yourself on graph concepts

If you follow this structured approach, graphs will feel easy! 😃🚀

What You Must Remember (No Code, Just Key Ideas!)
1️⃣ BFS vs. DFS
✔️ Use BFS when finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
✔️ Use DFS when checking connectivity or exploring deep paths

2️⃣ When to Use Dijkstra’s vs. Bellman-Ford
✔️ Dijkstra’s → No negative weights, priority queue needed
✔️ Bellman-Ford → Can handle negative weights but slower

3️⃣ Difference Between Kruskal’s & Prim’s MST
✔️ Kruskal’s → Uses Union-Find, sorts edges first
✔️ Prim’s → Uses priority queue, grows MST dynamically

4️⃣ When to Use Topological Sorting
✔️ Only for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
✔️ Used in task scheduling (e.g., "Course Schedule")

5️⃣ When to Use Union-Find
✔️ Great for cycle detection in undirected graphs
✔️ Useful for "merging groups" problems

6️⃣ How to Detect a Cycle
✔️ Undirected Graph → Use Union-Find
✔️ Directed Graph → Use DFS with recursion stack
