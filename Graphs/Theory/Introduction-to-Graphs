# Introduction to Graphs

Graphs are a fundamental data structure used in computer science to represent relationships between objects. A graph consists of a set of nodes (also called vertices) and a set of edges that connect pairs of nodes.

## Key Concepts

1. **Nodes (Vertices)**: The individual elements or points in a graph.
2. **Edges**: The connections between the nodes. Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).

## Types of Graphs

1. **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges have no direction. The connection between two nodes is bidirectional.
2. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph where edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship.
3. **Weighted Graph**: A graph where edges have weights or costs associated with them.
4. **Unweighted Graph**: A graph where edges do not have any weights.

## Graph Representation

Graphs can be represented in several ways:

1. **Adjacency Matrix**: A 2D array where the cell at row `i` and column `j` indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between nodes `i` and `j`.
2. **Adjacency List**: An array of lists. The index represents a node, and the list at that index contains the nodes that are connected to it.
3. **Edge List**: A list of all edges in the graph, where each edge is represented as a pair (or tuple) of nodes.

## Applications of Graphs

Graphs are used in various applications, including:

- Social networks (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Navigation systems (e.g., Google Maps)
- Network routing (e.g., the internet)
- Recommendation systems (e.g., Amazon, Netflix)

Understanding graphs and their properties is essential for solving many real-world problems efficiently.
