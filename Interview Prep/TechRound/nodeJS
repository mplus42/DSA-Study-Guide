### Node.js Interview Questions & Perfectly Structured Answers for Cognizant ðŸš€

Letâ€™s make these answers easy to understand and even easier to recall! Iâ€™ll break them down with simple explanations, analogies, and practical examples.

---

## 1. **What is Node.js?**
Think of Node.js as a kitchen where a chef (server) can cook many dishes (requests) at once without waiting for one dish to finish. Itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, which executes JavaScript code outside the browser.

**Key points to remember:**
- Server-side JavaScript
- Built on V8 engine (fast!)
- Non-blocking, event-driven

---

## 2. **How does Node.js work?**
Imagine a waiter taking multiple orders without waiting for one order to be served. Node.js uses a single thread to handle multiple requests via an event loop, so it doesnâ€™t get stuck waiting for a response.

**Key points:**
- Single-threaded, but handles many requests
- Uses an event loop to process tasks asynchronously

---

## 3. **What are the advantages of Node.js?**
Think of Node.js like a food truck: quick, efficient, and perfect for small, fast dishes.

- **Speed:** Powered by Googleâ€™s V8 engine
- **Non-blocking I/O:** Handles multiple requests simultaneously
- **JavaScript everywhere:** Use the same language for frontend and backend
- **Huge ecosystem:** Access to thousands of packages with npm

---

## 4. **What is the event loop?**
Picture a secretary checking a to-do list: they complete tasks as theyâ€™re ready, not in a fixed order. Node.js uses the event loop to handle asynchronous operations, constantly checking for completed tasks and executing their callbacks.

**Key points:**
- Heart of Node.js
- Manages async tasks
- Ensures non-blocking execution

---

## 5. **Difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**
- **Synchronous:** Like waiting in line at a bank â€” one customer at a time.
- **Asynchronous:** Like ordering coffee at a cafÃ© â€” you place the order, sit down, and get called when it's ready.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Synchronous (blocking)
const data = fs.readFileSync('file.txt');
console.log(data);

// Asynchronous (non-blocking)
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

---

## 6. **What are callbacks?**
Imagine you tell your friend to call you after they get home â€” thatâ€™s a callback! In Node.js, a callback is a function passed to another function, executed once the task is done.

**Example:**
```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
  callback();
}

greet("Alice", function() {
  console.log("Welcome to Node.js!");
});
```

---

## 7. **What are streams?**
Streams are like water pipes â€” data flows through them in chunks instead of loading all at once.

- **Readable streams:** Reading data (like from a file)
- **Writable streams:** Writing data (like to a file)
- **Duplex streams:** Both readable & writable
- **Transform streams:** Modify data as it passes through

**Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const stream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
stream.on('data', chunk => {
  console.log(chunk);
});
```

---

## 8. **process.nextTick() vs setImmediate()?**
- **process.nextTick():** Executes immediately after the current operation finishes.
- **setImmediate():** Executes in the next cycle of the event loop.

**Example:**
```javascript
process.nextTick(() => console.log("nextTick"));
setImmediate(() => console.log("setImmediate"));
```

**Output:**
```
nextTick
setImmediate
```

---

## 9. **What is npm?**
npm (Node Package Manager) is like an app store for Node.js packages. It helps you install, manage, and share libraries and tools.

**Commands:**
- `npm init` â†’ Create a package.json file
- `npm install package-name` â†’ Install a package

---

## 10. **What is package.json?**
Think of `package.json` as your projectâ€™s resume â€” it describes your project and lists all its dependencies.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.1"
  }
}
```

---

## 11. **What are middleware functions in Express.js?**
Middleware functions are like security guards or traffic controllers. They process requests before passing them to route handlers.

**Example:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received');
  next();
});
```

---

## 12. **How does Node.js handle errors?**
Imagine you catch a falling glass before it shatters â€” thatâ€™s how error handling works.

- **Sync errors:** Use `try...catch`
- **Async errors:** Use error-first callbacks or promises

**Example:**
```javascript
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error reading file:", err);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

---

## 13. **What is the V8 engine?**
V8 is like a turbo engine for JavaScript â€” it compiles JS code into machine code, making it super fast.

- Built by Google (used in Chrome)
- Powers Node.js performance

---

## 14. **What are closures?**
Closures are like backpacks â€” a function carries the variables of its outer function, even after the outer function finishes.

**Example:**
```javascript
function outer() {
  const message = "Hello";
  return function inner() {
    console.log(message);
  };
}
const greet = outer();
greet();
```

**Output:**
```
Hello
```
