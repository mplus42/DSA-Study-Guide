Amazon Online Assessment - 7-Day Study Plan
To help you ace this assessment, hereâ€™s a structured plan:

Day 1 (Today) - Get Familiar with the Assessment
âœ… Go through the Amazon Leadership Principles (important for Work Simulation & Work Style Survey)
âœ… Take the Coding Assessment Demo (get comfortable with the platform)
âœ… Review past Amazon assessment experiences on LeetCode/Glassdoor

Day 2 - Practice Amazon-Specific Coding Questions
âœ… Solve 2 medium-level problems from each category:

Arrays & Strings (e.g., Two Sum, Sliding Window problems)
Sorting & Searching (e.g., Binary Search, QuickSort, Merge Intervals)
âœ… Time yourself to simulate the real test

Day 3 - Dynamic Programming & Recursion
âœ… Solve 2-3 DP problems (e.g., Coin Change, Climbing Stairs, Longest Common Subsequence)
âœ… Practice recursion problems (e.g., Subsets, Permutations)
âœ… Read DP pattern-based approaches

Day 4 - Graphs & Trees
âœ… Solve 2 problems on Trees (e.g., Lowest Common Ancestor, BFS/DFS)
âœ… Solve 2 problems on Graphs (e.g., Shortest Path, Connected Components)

Day 5 - Mock Test Day
âœ… Set a timer for 90 minutes and solve 2 coding questions (simulate the real test)
âœ… Identify weak areas and review mistakes
âœ… Go through Amazonâ€™s Work Simulation & Work Style Surveys practice questions

Day 6 - Optimization & Debugging
âœ… Solve 2 problems with a focus on writing optimized solutions
âœ… Learn how to debug quickly in an online coding environment
âœ… Review Big-O complexities of common algorithms

Day 7 - Final Revision & Rest
âœ… Go through your notes, key formulas, and concepts
âœ… Review Amazon Leadership Principles again
âœ… Relax and ensure you are mentally prepared for the test
