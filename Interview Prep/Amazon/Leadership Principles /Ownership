Question : Tell me about a time you took ownership of a project beyond your responsibility.
Describe a time you took initiative to solve a major issue.

Situation:
While working at CoachFirst as a Full Stack Developer (Website), a critical issue occurred in the React Native app—it was crashing, making it unusable for customers. The app developer team was unavailable as it was late at night, and the issue needed an immediate fix to prevent disruption.

Behavior:
I took ownership of the issue even though the mobile app was not my primary responsibility.
I investigated the root cause and found that the crash was due to an API calling issue.
I debugged the API issue, made the necessary fix, and tested the app to ensure stability.
Impact:
✅ Resolved the crash quickly, preventing prolonged downtime for customers.
✅ Ensured smooth app functionality, avoiding further disruptions.
✅ Demonstrated ownership and problem-solving skills, gaining trust from the team.

Key Takeaway:
By taking initiative and ownership, I solved a critical issue outside my core responsibility, ensuring minimal customer impact and showcasing my ability to step up in urgent situations.
