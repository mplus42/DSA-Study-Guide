# Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. It is often used for solving constraint satisfaction problems.

## Introduction
Backtracking is a refinement of the brute force approach. It systematically searches for a solution to a problem among all available options. It is particularly useful for problems involving permutations, combinations, and other combinatorial structures.

## Key Concepts
- **Decision Tree**: A tree structure where each node represents a decision point.
- **Pruning**: The process of eliminating paths that do not lead to a solution.
- **Recursive Backtracking**: A method where the function calls itself to explore all possible solutions.

## Common Problems
- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
- **Sudoku Solver**: Filling a 9×9 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.
- **Subset Sum Problem**: Determining if there is a subset of a given set with a sum equal to a given number.
- **Permutations and Combinations**: Generating all possible permutations or combinations of a given set.
