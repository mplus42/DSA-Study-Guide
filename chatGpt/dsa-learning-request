If you want easy-to-remember breakdown for any DSA topic, hereâ€™s the perfect instruction you can give to chatGpt:

"Explain [topic name] in a simple, detailed, and engaging way, using analogies, real-life examples, and code snippets. Structure the explanation step-by-step, and break complex concepts into small, easy-to-understand parts, just like a story."

For example:

"Explain the two-pointer technique for arrays in a simple, story-like way with examples and key points."
"Teach me dynamic programming like Iâ€™m 10 years old, with clear examples and practical coding scenarios."
"Give me an interview-ready explanation of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, step by step, with visuals or intuitive analogies."
Would you like me to create a template you can reuse for learning any DSA topic? Let me know â€” Iâ€™d be thrilled to help you master DSA! ðŸš€
