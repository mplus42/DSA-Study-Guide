## Introduction

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

## Key Concepts

- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Problems that can be broken down into smaller, repeating subproblems.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution of the problem can be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.
- **Memoization**: Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Tabulation**: Building a table in a bottom-up manner to solve the problem.

## Common Problems

Here are some common dynamic programming problems:

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Knapsack Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Coin Change Problem
- Edit Distance
